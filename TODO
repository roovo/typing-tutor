- Model.exercise should be a MaybeExercise
- Event.actual should be a Char (called character)
- Exercise.followEvents - rename func to something more meaningful
- Routes - move routes and urlFor up the file
- show stats summaries
  - graph over time of accuracy and wpm
- [BUG] need to prevent default on typed characters
- scrolling when exercise is longer than the viewport
- how to show a loading state when the page is drawn bu we're waiting for
  data from the backend (have been some discussions/posts on this recently)
- don't get the exercise contents when getting the list of exercies
  just get it when you start the exercise
- [Rob, Joe, Tom] show characters wot are mis-typed as they are entered
- [Rob, Tom] advance the cursor whilst mis-typing so you can
  see how many backspaces you need to type
- auto-pause the timer if nothing typed for a while
- track slow characters (as in slow to type)
- pretty-fication
- calculate statistics
  - perhaps save tuples of (expected, actual) for mis-types
      - only do this for the first mistake if there are more
        than one mistakes in a row
  - print which characters you got wrong


done
====
- hardcode a basic input string
- show in code block as spans class "outstanding" (gray)
- have first character class "current" (background yellow)
- read keyboard input & advance current character class when letter typed
- only advance if correct letter typed
- show red if incorrect letter typed
- see if grouping each letter with a status makes things simpler
- why can't I correct the last chracter?
- backspaces go back
- track how many errored characters have been typed
- require backspace(s) after errors
- don't handle backspaces separately
- could I put a movement element in the Chunk
- add a safeZipper that doesn't exceed it's bounds
- use Forward | Backward | Still for Chunk.next
- simplify Script.moveZipper (using the above)
- rename Script.chunks -> Script.toList
- rename Script.tick -> Script.consume (ditto for Chunk)
- simplify Script.setCurrentStatus (if I can work out how)
- detect if finished - print completion message on the screen
- should I rename Script -> Exercise
    && Chunk -> Step
    && Script.workbook -> Script.steps
    && Script.toList -> Script.steps
- calculate statistics
  - save the total number of mis-typed characters (excluding backspaces)
  - print accuracy
- improved readme
- add a timer
  - show time taken
  - print wpm
  - show the time mins : secs on screen whilst exercise is in progress
- does it work with multi-line strings?
  - ignore whitespace at start of a line
- use some elm code as the source
- have an example in a file
- navigation - meaningful urls
- API & back end
  - serve list of exercises from the back end
  - serve exercise from a back end
- BUG - the api is serving up lines with trailling whitespace
  should make it so that if it does it is removed...
- Exercise tests need updating
- save attempts to a back end
- save current time when creating an attempt
  - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38021777/how-do-i-get-the-current-time-in-elm-0-17
- BUG -> can get accuaracy of over 100% - perhaps it's cause I'm
  counting leading whitespace as a character??
- BUG -> if empty lines contain whitespace it is not removed when
         showing the exercise (try the elm exercise to see this)
- BUG -> doesn't like whitespace at the start of the first line
         - needs to set current to the first real character
           and the zipper too
- BUG (probably) it should start in the right place if ther are
  blank lines at the start of the exercise
- better combining of parsers perhaps using andMap instead of
  map & List.concatMap
- remove ExampleExercise
- move event stream into Attempt
- move wpm and accuracy calcs into Attempt
- add tests that the event stream ignores Skip's
- set the styles based purely on the event stream
- bug (I think) - accuracy calcs are wrong - if I mistype a letter
  then type the correct one the maths will be wrong...
- Remove the need for many of the different status's of character
  - should just need Untyepables - Skip, End and Typeable - Char
- does step need moveto?
- no more need for Zipper for the steps - although will have to do something
  equivalentish to the SafeZipper for event replay....
- can I just create the zipper on demand and only save the text on the model?
- event stream re-design
  - with no zipper, can I represent the steps as a List Line, where each
    Line is a List Step - leave this for now
  - review code - is it better, can it be made simpler?
  - is the End status actually needed? - could probably loose it but not
    a big enough deal for now - better to get some more features in place...
- make Step a union type of Typeable Char | Skip String | End
- Msg remove commented out message
