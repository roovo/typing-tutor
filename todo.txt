done
====
- hardcode a basic input string
- show in code block as spans class "outstanding" (gray)
- have first character class "current" (background yellow)
- read keyboard input & advance current character class when letter typed
- only advance if correct letter typed
- show red if incorrect letter typed
- see if grouping each letter with a status makes things simpler
- why can't I correct the last chracter?
- backspaces go back
- track how many errored characters have been typed
- require backspace(s) after errors
- don't handle backspaces separately
- could I put a movement element in the Chunk
- add a safeZipper that doesn't exceed it's bounds
- use Forward | Backward | Still for Chunk.next
- simplify Script.moveZipper (using the above)
- rename Script.chunks -> Script.toList
- rename Script.tick -> Script.consume (ditto for Chunk)
- simplify Script.setCurrentStatus (if I can work out how)
